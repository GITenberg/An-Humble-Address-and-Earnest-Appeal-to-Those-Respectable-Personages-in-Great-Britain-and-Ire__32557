title: An Humble Address and Earnest Appeal to Those Respectable Personages in Great-Britain
  and Ireland, Who, by Their Great and Permanent Interest in Landed Property, Their
  Liberal Education, Elevated Rank, and Enlarged Views, Are the Ablest to Judge, and
  the Fittest to Decide, Whether a Connection with, Or a Separation from the Continental
  Colonies of America, Be Most for the National Advantage, and the Lasting Benefit
  of These Kingdoms
